# Spread of Distributions


## 
### Let's Remember This Example
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}
Let’s assume we managed to collect data from our squirrels on campus :) Our class was divided into three groups, and each group measured the weights (lbs) of 10 squirrels. Here are the results:

__Group 1:__ 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25 

__Group 2:__ 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5

__Group 3:__ 1.0, 1.4, 1.2, 1.4, 1.1, 1.3, 1.6, 1.0, 1.2, 1.3

Dr. Demirci mentioned that looking at these numbers is so confusing. Can you please calculate the sample mean for them to summarize this data?

::: fragment
All these groups calculated the same mean, which is 1.25 lbs. Dr. Demirci seemed not so happy with this number.

## Spread of Distribution
::: {style="font-size: 32px"}

- So far, we've explored the shapes and central tendencies of distributions
  - but an effective depiction of a distribution should also capture its dispersion
      - whether the observations in the sample are mostly uniform or exhibit significant variation.
- We can also report this by using
  - Range
  - Standard Deviation
  - Interquartile Range
  
:::

## Range
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

- Range is one of the measures of dispersion indicating the difference between __largest__ and __smallest__ observations in a sample.

- Let's calculate range 
  - __Group 1:__ $1.25 - 1.25 = 0$
  - __Group 2:__ $1.5 - 1.0 = 0.5$
  - __Group 3:__ $1.6 - 1.0 = 0.6$


::: fragment
::: callout-warning

- Range is easy to calculate, but very sensitive to extreme values
  - It is __not__ robust.

:::
:::

:::
## Standard Deviation and Variance
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

![](img/sd-calculation.png){fig-align="center"}

- __Variance__ is denoted as $s^2$, which is the standard deviation squared 
- Let's calculate standard deviation for each squirrel group!

### Comparison of Measures of Dispersion

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

- The range is simple to understand, but it can be a poor descriptive measure because it depends only on the extreme tails of the distribution. 
  - highly nonrobust.
- The interquartile range, by contrast, describes the spread in the central “body” of the distribution. 
- The standard deviation takes account of all the observations and can roughly be interpreted in terms of the spread of the observations around their mean. 
  - However, the SD can be inflated by observations in the extreme tails. 
- The interquartile range is a robust measure, while the SD is not robust.

# Probability and the Life Sciences

## 
### Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
::: {style="text-align: left; font-size: 25px"}

- _Descriptive statistics_ are instrumental in describing, summarizing, and exploring our data.
  - However, our ambitions often extend beyond the specific animals, plants, microorganisms, or units observed. 
    - We aim to construct models for prediction, make generalizations, and draw conclusions (_inferential statistics_) by looking at our sample characteristics.
  
- BUT how can _Homo sapiens_ make inferences in a complex and imperfect world, which typically surpasses their understanding?
  - Despite their best efforts, every piece of equipment they manufacture will inevitably have a failure rate.
  - Travel plans? Well, they can't be sure that nothing unexpected will pop up. (Did our ancestors accurately predict their next evolutionary leap, or were they even aware of it? Probably too busy avoiding/hunting [saber-toothed tigers](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34944560) .)
  
  - The effect they expect to see in your treatment group? Well, there is a risk involved with every treatment.
    - How can they deal with uncertainties? __(_Discuss with your neighbor_)__

## 
#### Statistical Theory, Probability, and Inferential Statistics

::: {style="text-align: left; font-size: 28px"}

- Statistical theory provides guidance by, 
  - utilizing __random sampling models__ and accounting for __data variability__. 
  - encouraging us to view our study data as a sample _(a representative one)_ from a larger population,
    - with the population being the primary focus of scientific or practical curiosity.
  - AND most importantly, these inferences are shaped by the __rules of probability__!
    - armed with the rules of probability, we can make informed decisions that increase the likelihood of a good outcome.
    - And inferential statistics, with its roots in probability theory, allows us to calculate risks in our research.

##
#### Probability, Chance, and Life Science
::: {style="text-align: left; font-size: 28px"}

- The concept of probability, or chance, holds significance in our scientific understanding of living systems.
  - Certain biological processes are directly influenced by chance, such as
    - The Law of Segregation and the occurrence of mutations.
- Even when chance is not inherent in the biological process itself, 
  - experimental results are invariably influenced by it: 
    - random fluctuations in environmental conditions, 
    - chance variations in the genetic makeup of experimental animals.
  - Chance also plays a role in the design of experiments; 
    - e.g., varieties of wheat may be randomly assigned to plots in a field.

### Probability and Inferential Statistics

::: {style="text-align: left; font-size: 28px"}

Some important statements to understand

- Inferential statistics is based on the _probability of a certain outcome_ happening by __chance__.(Dawson, 2008, p.59)
  - A __probability__ is a numerical quantity that indicates the likelihood of an event.
  - The probability spans from 0 (no likelihood of the event occurring), to 1 (a guaranteed outcome).
    - both of which are __quite rare__ in life.
  - Events in life science usually have probabilities ranging between 0 and 1.
    - _p_ value: a probability value indicating the occurrence of an event __by chance__.
    - __percentage (_%_)__: a _p_ value multiplied by 100.
- Probability of an event can be the long-run relative frequency of occurrence of the event*

#### Quick Reminders from High School Probability Lectures
::: {style="text-align: left; font-size: 28px"}
- Coin tossing
  - What is the probability of getting heads in a single toss of a fair coin?  
  - See Example 3.2.1 in our course textbook!
- Dice rolling
  - "If you roll a fair six-sided die, what is the probability of getting a 6?  
  - See Example 3.5.1 in our course textbook!


:::{.callout-important}
- The calculation of these probabilities is based on discrete probability distributions of categorical/discrete variables.
- Tomorrow, we will delve into the calculation of probabilities for continuous variables.
