### Creating This Week's Quarto Document


::: callout-tip

- Let's create this week's Quarto document by clicking `File > New File > Quarto Document`
- Give a title as "Week 3 Lab 3 Descriptive Statistics"  
- Add your own notes and the given codes to this document  
- DO NOT FORGET to save it to your STAT 218 Folder!

## Library Function in R
::: {style="font-size: 30px"}


The `library()` function in R is like opening a toolbox. Imagine you have a toolbox filled with different tools, and each tool helps you do a specific job. Similarly, in R, a library is like a toolbox that contains specialized tools (packages) for specific tasks.

When you use the `library()` function, you're telling R to open a specific toolbox (load a package) so that you can access and use the tools inside.

::: fragment

Let's add a code chunk to our Quarto document and type the code below.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)

```

## How to Load Data into R

We have two different ways to do that (within the scope of this class)

- Using an available dataset stored in R (packages)
- Importing a dataset from an outside source


## 

::: {style="font-size: 30px"}

Let's use a dataset from `openintro` package.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false

data("births")

```

## 
### Import Dataset from An Outside Source 

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

We can import data from Text (.txt) or Excel (.csv OR .xls). 

Please download the dataset available on Canvas page titled as `Data For Lab 3`.

Below, you see an example how to load data into R.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false

haircolordata <- read_csv("lab3data.csv")

```
:::

## 

### Getting to Know Your Data
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

After importing our data, it is important to familiarize with our data. We have some functions to do that. 

Let's start with `glimpse()` function. The name of this function is self-explanatory. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
glimpse(haircolordata)

```

`glimpse()` function gives us a brief information about out data set. We have  __`r ncol(haircolordata)` variables__ and __`r nrow(haircolordata)` cases__ or __observations__.

:::

## 

### Getting to Know Your Data
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

Alternatively, we can ask R the number of columns (variables) and rows (cases) as following:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: true
ncol(haircolordata) ## gives us the number of columns (variables)
nrow(haircolordata) ## gives us the number of rows (cases)

```

Assume that I would like to see just the names of the variables in my data set. I can use `name()`function for this.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: true
names(haircolordata)
```

:::

## 
### Frequency Distribution Table (An Ugly One!)
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}
Let's construct a frequency distribution table by using `count()`function. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: true
count(haircolordata, Birth)

```
:::

## 
### Measures of Central Tendency

We can calculate measures of central tendency by using these unsurprising functions.


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: true

mean(haircolordata$Height)
median(haircolordata$Height)
```

## 
### Measures of Central Tendency

Alternatively, you can use `summarize()` function for the same calculation.


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: true

summarize(haircolordata, mean(Height))
summarize(haircolordata, median(Height))

```


## 
### Measures of Dispersion

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false

sd(haircolordata$Height) # sample standard deviation
var(haircolordata$Height) # sample variance
```

Alternatively, you can use `summarize()` function.


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: true

summarize(haircolordata, sd(Height))
summarize(haircolordata, var(Height))

```

## Or...


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: true

summarize(haircolordata,
          mean(Height),
          median(Height),
          sd(Height),
          var(Height))
```



## An Example for Bar Chart

Let's plot a simple bar chart. Next session, we will explore other features for `ggplot()`.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
ggplot(data = haircolordata,
       aes(x = Hair,
           fill = Hair)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  labs(title = "Hair Color of Participants",
       x = "Hair Color",
       y = "Number of Participants"
       )
```
