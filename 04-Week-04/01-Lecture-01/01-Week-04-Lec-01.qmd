### This week, we will...


- describe the concept of "sampling distribution".  
- identify the relationship between sample size and the accuracy of the sample mean.  
- explain the Central Limit Theorem (fingers crossed!) 
- calculate Confidence Intervals for Âµ .
- elaborate on data visualization techniques in R.
- review the topics for Midterm 1.


## Introduction
::: {style="font-size: 30px"}

- In data analysis, our primary goal as life scientists is to distinguish actual biological features from those that might be the result of random chance.

- Generally we obtain a single random sample, which comes from a very large population.
  - Today, we will explore the outcomes of selecting:   
    - a single random sample with the different sample sizes and
    - infinitely many random samples with replacement from the same population.
  - Then, we will solve a problem which will be very similar with your homework

- Please remember the Example 4.3.1 from our course textbook. 

::: fragment
__Length of Fish:__ Here is what we know about the shape and population parameters:
::: 

- The lengths of the individual fish follow a normal distribution (a symmetric and bell-shaped)
  - $\mu$ = 54.0 mm 
  - $\sigma$ = 4.5 mm

- We calculated several percentages of the fish are
  - less than 60 mm long (90.82% of the fish)  
  - more than 51 mm long (74.86% of the fish)
  - between 51 and 60 mm long (65.68% of the fish)

- Now, our job today is to predict what would happen if we selected random samples with replacement from this fish POPULATION in different scenarios.

## Thoughts on the Questions
::: {style="font-size: 32px"}

- The size of your random sample affects the accuracy of your single sample mean.
- There will be some sample values that might surprise you.
- Consider the sample mean as a variable, as you may obtain different sample means in each trial.  
- The distribution of all possible sample means tends to have a familiar shape.

- In the length of fish example, we predicted what would happen in two different scenarios.

- Let's use our [applet](https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/oneprop/OneProp.htm?candy=1) to see another example regarding proportions.

## 
### Steps To Be Followed:

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}


We will draw multiple samples of three different sizes and simulate data to observe how it affects the variability of the sample proportions for different sample sizes. 

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="font-size: 27px"}
__Your Turn:__  

- Number of Candies is 10  
  - Set the probability of orange is 0.5  
  - Fix the number of candies at 10  
  - __Choose statistics__ as Number of Orange  
  - Observe what happens if you draw only 1 sample.  
  - Repeat this 4-5 times.
  - Observe what happens if you increase the number of samples to 1,000.  
  - Click on "Summary Statistics"

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="font-size: 27px"}
__My Turn:__

- Number of Candies is 10, 25, 1000
  - Set the probability of orange is 0.5
  - Fix the number of candies as 10, then 25, AND 1000
  - __Choose statistics__  as the proportion of orange
  - Observe what happens if you have only 1-3 samples.
  - Observe what happens if you increase the number of samples to 1,000.
  - Use snipping tool to compare the shapes of the distributions.

### Take Away Messages

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

<br>

::: fragment
__1. In real life, it is impossible to take infinitely many random samples.__

Life scientists often work with one single sample.

:::

::: fragment
__2. Sample statistics vary from sample to sample.__

We see different proportions in each trial.

:::

::: fragment
__3. The mean of the all possible sample proportions converges to the population proportion.__

We increased the number of samples to 1000 and we saw that the proportion distribution of the all sample proportions converges to the population proportion.
:::

::: fragment
__4. Sample size is important.__

We tested different sample sizes and we observed the as we increase sample size, the standard deviation tends to decrease.
:::
:::

## Fish Length Example

We can apply these take away messages to the fish length variable.

::: fragment
### Vocabulary Time

__Sampling variability:__ The variability among random samples from the same population.  

__Sampling distribution:__ A probability distribution that describes sampling variability in $\bar Y$.

Let's elaborate sampling distribution of $\bar Y$.
