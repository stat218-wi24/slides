## 
### Let's Refresh Our Memory

Last week we...

- examined the spread of distributions  
- reviewed the basics of probability 
- identified the relationship between probability and the life science 
- had an introduction to normal curves 
- learned several ways to assess Normality
- performed some summary statistics functions in R

## This Week


- describe sampling distributions.  
- identify the relationship between sample size and the accuracy of the sample mean.  
- explain Central Limit Theorem (fingers crossed!) 
- calculate Confidence Interval for Âµ 
- review the Midterm 1 topics.


# Revisiting Fish Length Example
::: {style="font-size: 30px"}

## 

- Please remember the Example 4.3.1 from our course textbook. 

::: fragment
__Length of Fish:__ Here is what we know about the shape and population parameters:
::: 

- The lengths of the individual fish follow a normal distribution (a symmetric and bell-shaped)
  - $\mu$ = 54.0 mm 
  - $\sigma$ = 4.5 mm

- We calculated several percentages of the fish are
  - less than 60 mm long (90.82% of the fish)  
  - more than 51 mm long (74.86% of the fish)
  - between 51 and 60 mm long (65.68% of the fish)

- Now, our job today is to guess what would happen if we select random samples with replacement from this fish POPULATION in different scenarios.
