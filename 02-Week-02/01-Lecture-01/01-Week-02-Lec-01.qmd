## What is a Variable?
::: {style="font-size: 32px"}

__Variable:__ It is a characteristics of an observational unit that can be assigned a number or a category.

:::

## 
### Categorical Variables - Nominal & Ordinal
::: {style="font-size: 30px"}

- __Nominal Variables__ are those which categorized into distinct groups without *any order or hierarchy*
  - e.g., blood type, color of a flower, sex of a squirrel...

- __Ordinal Variables__ are those which can be ranked in a meaningful way. 
  - e.g., The stages of a disease
  - Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree
  - no credit, partial credit, full credit.
  - Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior

:::

## Numeric Variables - Discrete

:::{.nonincremental}

- __Discrete Variables__ are those whose possible values can be listed. In other words, there are some spaces between those possible values
  - Count of bacteria colonies in a petri dish
  - Number of chromosomes in a cell

:::

## Numeric Variables - Continuous

- __Continuous Variables__ are those that can be measured on a continuous scale.
  - e.g., weight of a squirrel
  - Alkaline phosphatase level (U/l) in a blood sample
  - height of a tree

::: fragment
::: callout-warning
The boundary between continuous and discrete variables is not fixed or inflexible.

## 
### Notations

- We employ a symbolic convention to differentiate between a __variable__ and __an observed value of that variable__.
  - $Y = weight$ (__Variable__)
  - $y = 12.8$ lb (__Observed Value__)




# Frequency Distributions

## Introduction


- A __frequency distribution__ is a representation of the frequency, indicating how often each value appears in a dataset. 
- This information can be conveyed through tables or, more visually, using a graph.


# Summarizing Categorical Data

## A Frequency Distribution Table 

In this section, you will see two examples for summarizing a single categorical variable.

<br>

::: fragment
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: true
#| warning: false
library(openintro)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
data(babies)


babies$smoke_logical <- as.logical(babies$smoke)

frequency_distribution <- table(babies$smoke_logical)

frequency_distribution_df <- as.data.frame(frequency_distribution)

frequency_distribution_df <- rename(frequency_distribution_df, Smoking_Status = Var1, Frequency = Freq)

total_row <- data.frame(Smoking_Status = "Total", Frequency = sum(frequency_distribution_df$Frequency))
frequency_distribution_df <- rbind(frequency_distribution_df, total_row)

kable(frequency_distribution_df, caption = "Frequency Distribution of Smoking Status")

```

:::


## Bar Chart 

A visual representation of categorical data that illustrates the quantity of observations within each category.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: true
#| warning: false
babies <- babies %>% 
  mutate(smoke = as.logical(smoke))
ggplot(data = na.omit(babies), 
       aes(x = smoke)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## Another Example

```{r}
set.seed(156465454)

likert_data <- data.frame(
  participant_id = 1:100,
  likert_response = sample(1:5, 100, replace = TRUE)
)

likert_data$likert_response_text <- factor(likert_data$likert_response, levels = 1:5, labels = c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree", "Neutral", "Agree", "Strongly Agree"))

likert_frequency <- table(likert_data$likert_response_text)
likert_frequency_df <- as.data.frame(likert_frequency)
likert_frequency_df <- rename(likert_frequency_df, Likert_Response = Var1, Frequency = Freq)
total_row <- data.frame(Likert_Response = "Total", Frequency = sum(likert_frequency_df$Frequency))
likert_frequency_df <- rbind(likert_frequency_df, total_row)
kable(likert_frequency_df, caption = "Climate change affects the quality of human life")

```

## 

::: {.panel-tabset group="binwidth" style="font-size: 80%"}

## Ordered (?)

```{r}
# Create a bar chart
barplot(likert_frequency, main = "Climate change affects the quality of human life", xlab = "Likert Response", ylab = "Frequency", col = "maroon")
```

## Ordered

```{r}
barplot(likert_frequency[order(likert_frequency, decreasing = TRUE)], 
        main = "Climate change affects the quality of human life", 
        xlab = "Likert Response", 
        ylab = "Frequency", 
        col = "maroon")
```

# Summarizing Numerical Data 

## Grouped Frequency Distributions

![](img/grouped.png)


## Histogram 

- A visual representation of the distribution of a dataset.  
  - The x-axis represents the range of values in the dataset, divided into bins, and the y-axis represents the frequency or count of data points within each bin.

::: fragment

**No Gaps between Bars:** Unlike a bar chart, there are no gaps between the bars in a histogram because the bins are contiguous.

:::

- Histograms provide insights into the underlying distribution of a dataset, helping to identify patterns, detect outliers, central tendency, and variability.
