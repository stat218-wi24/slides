In our first steps in R, we

- said "Hello World" by using `print()`function
- created an object by using _object assignment operator_ (<-)
- created a data frame
- installed `openintro`and `tidyverse` packages. 
  - If you did not install those, please install them by using `install.packages()`function

__What is Quarto?__ 

Quarto is...

- an open-source scientific and technical publishing system
- a multi-language, next-generation version of R Markdown.
- enabling you to combine code and text to create rich outputs, like reports and presentations. _(like an advanced version of a word processing tool)_

- R is the programming language for statistical computing  
- RStudio is the IDE that facilitates R programming  
- Quarto document is a document type that combines text and code  
- In short, we will create Quarto documents in RStudio and we will use text and R codes in that Quarto document.
