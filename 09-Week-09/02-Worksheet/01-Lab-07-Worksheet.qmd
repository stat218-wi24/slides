# Correlation


__Direction:__ Please run the code chunk below and load your data set as well as utilizing `library()` functions that you need.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: true

library(openintro)
library(tidyverse)
data("babies")

```


## Calculate Correlation Coefficient



__Question 1: Please run the code chunk below and comment on correlation coefficient.__


```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: true

cor(babies$gestation, babies$bwt, use = "na.or.complete")

```


## Outliers

Letâ€™s see the scatterplot to look for potential outliers.

```{r}
ggplot(na.omit(babies), aes(x = gestation, y = bwt)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot with Best-Fit Line",
       x = "Gestation",
       y = "Birth Weight")
```
__Question 2: Do we have potential outliers in this scatterplot?__

# Bivariate Regression

## Case of this Lab

In the realm of prenatal care and childbirth, understanding the relationship between gestation period and birth weight is crucial. We often speculate about how the duration of pregnancy might influence the weight of a newborn. To explore this, we turn to statistical analysis, specifically bivariate regression.

Imagine we have a dataset, such as the "babies" dataset, where each observation includes information about gestation period and birth weight. We want to investigate if there's a linear relationship between these two variables.
