## Least Squares Regression

```{r}
#| output: false
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
data("hsb2")
```


In this lab assignment, we explore the relationship between students' science and math scores using data from the High School and Beyond (HSB2) survey. The HSB2 dataset, a comprehensive survey conducted to understand various factors influencing academic achievement and well-being, serves as the foundation for our analysis. Our main goal is to investigate whether students' scores in science can be predicted based on their performance in math. By employing a least squares regression analysis, we aim to model the linear relationship between these two variables and uncover the influence of math proficiency on science performance.

## One-Way ANOVA

```{r}
#| output: false
optimism <- read_csv("anova-data.csv")
optimism <- optimism %>% 
  mutate(agegp3 = as.factor(agegp3))
```





The data stem from a survey conducted to explore factors influencing respondentsâ€™ psychological adjustment, health, and well-being. The researchers seek to examine whether there exists a statistically significant difference in optimism scores among young, middle-aged, and elderly subjects. (Note: Age is categorized into three groups for analysis.)
